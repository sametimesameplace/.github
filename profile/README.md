# SameTimeSamePlace 

Welcome to the SameTimeSamePlace project! Our goal is to bring people together who want to experience new things and get to know new people at the same time.

This project was created as our final project in a Python Backend Development course but we plan to complete it over time.
Currently, the backend is mostly done and functional but the frontend is still missing some functionality.

Contributions are always welcome of course - just open a PR!

## How to run

### Get the Backend
Head over to [the backend](https://github.com/sametimesameplace/backend) and follow the instructions there.
### Get the Frontend
