# SameTimeSamePlace 

Welcome to SameTimeSamePlace, a project aimed at bringing people together who are interested in experiencing new things and meeting new people simultaneously.

This project was initially developed as our final project for a Python Backend Development course. Although the backend is mostly complete and functional, the frontend still requires some additional functionality.

We intend to continue working on this project to enhance its features and usability over time. Contributions from the community are highly encouraged and greatly appreciated. If you have any improvements or additions, please feel free to open a pull request.
